## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

   ```

2. Open index.html in your browser to view the form.

Usage
Fill in the First Name, Last Name, Email, select a Query Type (General Enquiry or Support Request), write your message, and check the consent box.

If any validation fails, an error message will appear next to the relevant input.

On successful submission, a toast success message will display for 5 seconds.

The form resets after submission and focuses on the First Name field.

Accessibility
Proper semantic elements (<form>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <label>) used.

Focus styles applied to inputs and buttons for keyboard navigation.

Error messages and success messages are clearly visible.

Inputs and interactive elements have accessible labels.

The design and code aim to be screen-reader friendly.
